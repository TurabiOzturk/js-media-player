# Media Player

A simple media player application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using Vite as a build tool and development server. 

## Implemented Features

- Play, pause, and skip through a playlist of audio tracks
- Ability to click on a track in the playlist to play that specific track
- The background animates based on current track art's color palette.

## Features to Implement

- Songs will be stored in a JSON file, acting as a database
- Frontend for thumbs up/down functionality will be made functional to rate tracks (ratings will be saved persistently in a JSON file that will act like a database)
- Counter to display the number of times each song has been played (play counts will be saved persistently in the JSON file)
- Shuffle option to play tracks in random order
- Repeat option to continuously play the playlist/song on loop
- Users will be able to create new playlists from the available songs in the JSON file through enhanced UX
- Track data loading and unloading will be handled asynchronously
